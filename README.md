Pokemon Crystal - Clock Reset Code calculator

## Overview

In the Pokemon games on the Game Boy Color, there exists a hidden feature that is triggered by a secret key combination. This allows the palyer to reset the clock time of their game, and the behavior is documented in [this GameFAQs article](https://gamefaqs.gamespot.com/gbc/198308-pokemon-gold-version/faqs/12550).

I created this app to simplify the process of calculating the hidden password, so it doesn't have to be done manually.

For me this project was mostly an exercise in the Flutter UI framework. I knew I wanted it to be something simple, but still useful for me. 

## Development Environment

To develop this app, I used:

- [VSCode](https://code.visualstudio.com/) as my IDE (I couldn't get the Dart and Flutter language servers to work on Neovim)
- The [Dart programming language](https://dart.dev/)
- The [Flutter UI toolkit](https://flutter.dev)

## Useful Websites

- The [Flutter Documentation](https://docs.flutter.dev/)
- The [Dart Cheatsheet](https://dart.dev/codelabs/dart-cheatsheet)

## Usage

This app can be installed on an Android device as a sideloaded apk file. Run `flutter build apk`, assuming you have a completed Flutter Doctor setup.

You can view a demonstration of this app on its [YouTube Video](https://youtu.be/ByjD2OCXXSk).
